"""
Fetch ESPN fantasy FOOTBALL league data -> docs/data/.

Writes the season's standings to league_data.json and one matchup file per
week to week_<N>.json, so the Scoreboard loads only the week on screen.

Mirrors the baseball site's standings model:
  - each week, rank all teams by score -> ranking points (num_teams..1, ties averaged)
  - cumulative running total per team
  - normalize so the playoff-cutoff team = 0 (positive = in the playoff picture)

Auth: reads ESPN_S2 / SWID / FF_LEAGUE_ID from environment (never hard-coded here).
Private leagues need the cookies; they're the same ones as your ESPN account, so
the baseball league's cookies work if the football league is on that account.

Run:
    FF_LEAGUE_ID=xxxxx ESPN_S2=... SWID=... python3 src/fetch_data.py
or put them in a local (gitignored) .env and `source` it first.
